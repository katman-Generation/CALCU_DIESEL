# DEISEL CALCULATION

A small we application to help drivers with diesel calculations

## Description

the app will ask you to choose which trailer you are pulling first, and then it goes to ask you about if you where loaded, or empty. 
these two factors will determine which consumption rate you are going to be calculated with. (for the moment the app uses 3.4km/l on tri-axes without load, 
2.4km/l for tri-axes with load, link with load its 2.1km/l and lastly 3.2 on empty links). the app then goes to ask you for your mileage so that it can calculate distance moved.
